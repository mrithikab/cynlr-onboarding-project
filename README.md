# cynlr-onboarding-project
Onboarding project of Cynlr Software Engineering internship 2026. 
The project replicates the fuctionality of a line scan camera, implementing the Data generation block, which generates two elements per time step, and the Filter threshold block which applies a filter and and outputs 0/1 based on the threshold. 
The blocks internally will proccess elements the elements parallelly, but are connected to each other sequentially.

The project will be built using C++ 17 in VS Code 2022.
