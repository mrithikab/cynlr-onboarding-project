## This folder will contain timing and memory profiling logs/results.

### Profiling Code Organization Note

Although a separate profiling/ folder has already been created in the repository, the profiling-related code is currently placed alongside the core source files for ease of development and testing. This is a temporary arrangement intended to simplify iteration in the current version. In future versions, all profiling utilities and related files will be moved into the dedicated profiling/ folder to improve modularity and maintain clearer separation of concerns.
